Background:

In this assignment, we’ll use the concepts we've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.


PyBank:

In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. We will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

•	The total number of months included in the dataset

•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


In addition, final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.



PyPoll:
![Vote_counting](https://github.com/SakinaJaffri/Module_Challenge3_Python_Challenge/assets/146900226/62900afe-6424-429a-ad80-1db64dcb4dfa)


In this Challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

We will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

•	The total number of votes cast

•	A complete list of candidates who received votes

•	The percentage of votes each candidate won

•	The total number of votes each candidate won

•	The winner of the election based on popular vote



In addition, final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
