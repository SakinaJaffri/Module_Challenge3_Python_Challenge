# Python Challenge: PyBank & PyPoll

## Project Overview
This project includes two Python scripting tasks: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**. Both tasks utilize Python to analyze real-world datasets, one for financial analysis and the other for election vote counting.

## PyBank: Financial Record Analysis
In this challenge, a Python script is created to analyze financial records from a dataset (`budget_data.csv`) with the following details:
- **Dataset Columns**: Date, Profit/Losses
- **Tasks**:
  - Calculate the total number of months in the dataset.
  - Compute the net total of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" and the average of those changes.
  - Identify the greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
  - Identify the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).

The script outputs the analysis to the terminal and saves the results to a text file.

## PyPoll: Election Vote Analysis
In this challenge, we are tasked with analyzing election data from the dataset (`election_data.csv`) to help automate the vote-counting process. The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Dataset Columns**: Voter ID, County, Candidate
- **Tasks**:
  - Count the total number of votes cast.
  - List all candidates who received votes.
  - Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  - Calculate the total votes for each candidate.
  - Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

The script outputs the analysis to the terminal and saves the results to a text file.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Scripting language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Run the `pybank.py` or `pypoll.py` script in a Python environment.
4. Results will be displayed in the terminal and saved as a `.txt` file.
